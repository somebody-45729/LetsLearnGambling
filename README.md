Create an app that goes over (almost) all the mainstream games of casinos and gambling in a tutorial like basis (excluding the ones that don't require skill, just an explanatory of all the rules involved, like roulette); Not supporting actual gambling, just having the rules down as well as having a pre-emptive emphasis on the dangers of gambling.
